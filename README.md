# [#TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday)
A collection of my contributions to TidyTuesday.<br>
Please note, I often use #TidyTuesday to develop my technical abilities in data visualisation at the expense of not always producing something particularly meaningful or useful.

## 22/06/2021 Week 26: Public Park Access [(code)](https://github.com/AndyABaker/TidyTuesday/blob/main/2021_week26_publicparkaccess.R)
Finally found a reason to use trigonometric functions in a visualisation.

## 15/06/2021 Week 25: WEB Du Bois and Juneteenth [(code)](https://github.com/AndyABaker/TidyTuesday/blob/main/2021_week25_webduboisandjuneteenth.R)
I ran out of ideas this week so brushed up on some simple text analyses.

## 08/06/2021 Week 24: Great Lakes Fish [(code)](https://github.com/AndyABaker/TidyTuesday/blob/main/2021_week24_greatlakesfish.R)
First time using a map as a legend - I should probably do this more often.

## 01/06/2021 Week 23: Survivor TV Show [(code)](https://github.com/AndyABaker/TidyTuesday/blob/main/2021_week23_survivortvshow.R)
There was huge variation in total votes received for each personality type, but extroverts were generally more popular.

## 25/05/2021 Week 22: Mario Kart World Records [(code)](https://github.com/AndyABaker/TidyTuesday/blob/main/2021_week22_mariokartworldrecords.R)
I've only just discovered the ggflags package - this solves so many labelling problems.

## 18/05/2021 Week 21: Ask a Manager Salary Survey [(code)](https://github.com/AndyABaker/TidyTuesday/blob/main/2021_week21_askamanagersalarysurvey.R)
I'm really enjoying learning about using tokenized text as predictors in modelling from https://smltar.com/

## 11/05/2021 Week 20: US Broadband [(code)](https://github.com/AndyABaker/TidyTuesday/blob/main/2021_week20_usbroadband.R)
My first time using the amazing ggiraph package, visualising broadband access and usage across the US.

## 04/05/2021 Week 19: Water Access Points [(code)](https://github.com/AndyABaker/TidyTuesday/blob/main/2021_week19_wateraccesspoints.R)
I just wanted an excuse to plot a bivariate map this week :)

## 27/04/2021 Week 18: CEO Departures [(code)](https://github.com/AndyABaker/TidyTuesday/blob/main/2021_week18_ceodepartures.R)
Text analysis is certainly growing on me. Even fairly simplistic frequency statistics are so insightful.
![ceodepartures](https://github.com/AndyABaker/TidyTuesday/blob/main/2021_week18_ceodepartures.jpeg)

## 20/04/2021 Week 17: Netflix Titles [(code)](https://github.com/AndyABaker/TidyTuesday/blob/main/2021_week17_netflixtitles.R)
I'm still figuring out these network plots, but this was interesting nonetheless.
![netflixtitles](https://github.com/AndyABaker/TidyTuesday/blob/main/2021_week17_netflixtitles.png)

## 13/04/2021 Week 16: US Post Offices [(code)](https://github.com/AndyABaker/TidyTuesday/blob/main/2021_week16_postoffices.R)
It's so satisfying to watch the wave of post offices move west.
![postoffices](https://github.com/AndyABaker/TidyTuesday/blob/main/2021_week16_postoffices.gif)

## 06/04/2021 Week 15: Global deforestation [(code)](https://github.com/AndyABaker/TidyTuesday/blob/main/2021_week15_globaldeforestation.R)
First time making use of geom_sankey_bump and I'm loving it.
![globaldeforestation](https://github.com/AndyABaker/TidyTuesday/blob/main/2021_week15_globaldeforestation.jpeg)

## 30/03/2021 Week 14: Makeup Shades [(code)](https://github.com/AndyABaker/TidyTuesday/blob/main/2021_week14_makeupshades.R)
Just a quick and simple plot this week, but I discovered scale_colour_identity() so well worth it :)
![makeupshades](https://github.com/AndyABaker/TidyTuesday/blob/main/2021_week14_makeupshades.jpeg)

## 23/03/2021 Week 13: UN Votes [(code)](https://github.com/AndyABaker/TidyTuesday/blob/main/2021_week13_unvotes.R)
UMAP dimensionality reduction for the UN voting patterns (inspired by [Julia Silge's blog post](https://juliasilge.com/blog/un-voting/)) split by issue and continent.
![unvotes](https://github.com/AndyABaker/TidyTuesday/blob/main/2021_week13_unvotes.jpeg)

## 16/03/2021 Week 12: Video Games + Sliced [(code)](https://github.com/AndyABaker/TidyTuesday/blob/main/2021_week12_videogamessliced.R)
Quite an intriguing EDA this week. What happened to games releasing with less than 10 average players after 2018?
![videogamessliced](https://github.com/AndyABaker/TidyTuesday/blob/main/2021_week12_videogamessliced.jpeg)

## 09/03/2021 Week 11: Bechdel Test [(code)](https://github.com/AndyABaker/TidyTuesday/blob/main/2021_week11_bechdeltest.R)
It looks like action, adventure, and comedy movies that passed the Bechdel test have been generally more profitable in recent years. The opposite seems to be true for thrillers.
![bechdeltest](https://github.com/AndyABaker/TidyTuesday/blob/main/2021_week11_bechdeltest.jpeg)

## 02/03/2021 Week 10: SuperBowl Ads [(code)](https://github.com/AndyABaker/TidyTuesday/blob/main/2021_week10_superbowlads.R)
I love the look of stream graphs with ggstream, but I'm uneasy with the amount of smoothing going on.
![superbowlads](https://github.com/AndyABaker/TidyTuesday/blob/main/2021_week10_superbowlads.jpeg)

## 23/02/2021 Week 09: Employment and Earnings [(code)](https://github.com/AndyABaker/TidyTuesday/blob/main/2021_week09_employmentandearnings.R)
A dumbbell plot is always a good shout for plotting inequalities.
![employmentandearnings](https://github.com/AndyABaker/TidyTuesday/blob/main/2021_week09_employmentandearnings.jpeg)

## 16/02/2021 Week 08: W.E.B. Du Bois Challenge [(code)](https://github.com/AndyABaker/TidyTuesday/blob/main/2021_week08_webduboischallenge.R)
My attempt at replicating a classic chart from Du Bois for the #DuBoisChallenge.
![webduboischallenge](https://github.com/AndyABaker/TidyTuesday/blob/main/2021_week08_webduboischallenge.jpeg)

## 09/02/2021 Week 07: Wealth and Income [(code)](https://github.com/AndyABaker/TidyTuesday/blob/main/2021_week07_wealthandincome.R)
It was a challenge working out how best to visualise this data. I tried to avoid using legends by substituting them with colour coding and labelling.
![wealthandincome](https://github.com/AndyABaker/TidyTuesday/blob/main/2021_week07_wealthandincome.jpeg)

## 02/02/2021 Week 06: HBCU Enrollment [(code)](https://github.com/AndyABaker/TidyTuesday/blob/main/2021_week06_hbcuenrollment.R)
Just reminding myself on the basics of geom_text this week.
![hbcuenrollment](https://github.com/AndyABaker/TidyTuesday/blob/main/2021_week06_hbcuenrollment.jpeg)

## 26/01/2021 Week 05: Plastic Pollution [(code)](https://github.com/AndyABaker/TidyTuesday/blob/main/2021_week05_plasticpollution.R)
Of the litter recorded, the Coca-Cola Company has really taken the lead. I couldn't work out how to crop the plot area so I settled with the minimalist look.
![plasticpollution](https://github.com/AndyABaker/TidyTuesday/blob/main/2021_week05_plasticpollution.jpeg)

## 19/01/2021 Week 04: Kenya Census [(code)](https://github.com/AndyABaker/TidyTuesday/blob/main/2021_week04_kenyacensus.R)
The East-West divide between Christianity and Islam in Kenya. I've never attempted using pie charts (scatterpie) on a map before.
![kenyacensus](https://github.com/AndyABaker/TidyTuesday/blob/main/2021_week04_kenyacensus.jpeg)

## 12/01/2021 Week 03: Art Collections [(code)](https://github.com/AndyABaker/TidyTuesday/blob/main/2021_week03_artcollections.R)
I guess the golden ratio isn't as popular as I'd thought...
![artcollections](https://github.com/AndyABaker/TidyTuesday/blob/main/2021_week03_artcollections.jpeg)

## 05/01/2021 Week 02: Transit Costs Project [(code)](https://github.com/AndyABaker/TidyTuesday/blob/main/2021_week01_transitcost.R)
First time using ggMarginal (ggExtra) to produce marginal density plots and geom_text_repel (ggrepel) to add labels.
![transitcost](https://github.com/AndyABaker/TidyTuesday/blob/main/2021_week01_transitcosts.jpeg)

## 22/12/2020 Week 52: Big Mac Index [(code)](https://github.com/AndyABaker/TidyTuesday/blob/main/2020_week52_bigmac.R)
First time using geom_flame (heatwaveR) to produce simple area plots and ggtext to alter the subtitle colours.
![bigmac](https://github.com/AndyABaker/TidyTuesday/blob/main/2020_week52_bigmac.jpeg)

## 15/12/2020 Week 51: Ninja Warrior [(code)](https://github.com/AndyABaker/TidyTuesday/blob/main/2020_week51_ninjawarrior.R)
Experimental first attempt using the arcdiagram package. Obstacle coincidence in same locations in qualifying rounds.
![ninjawarrior](https://github.com/AndyABaker/TidyTuesday/blob/main/2020_week51_ninjawarrior.png)

## 8/12/2020 Week 50: Women of 2020 [(code)](https://github.com/AndyABaker/TidyTuesday/blob/main/2020_week50_bbcwomen.R)
First time generating wordclouds in R.
