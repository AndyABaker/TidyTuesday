## 09/02/2021 Week 07: Wealth and Income [(code)](https://github.com/AndyABaker/TidyTuesday/blob/main/2021_week07_wealthandincome.R)
It was a challenge working out how best to visualise this data. I tried to avoid using legends by substituting them with colour coding and labelling.

## 26/01/2021 Week 05: Plastic Pollution [(code)](https://github.com/AndyABaker/TidyTuesday/blob/main/2021_week05_plasticpollution.R)
Of the litter recorded, the Coca-Cola Company has really taken the lead. I couldn't work out how to crop the plot area so I settled with the minimalist look.

## 05/01/2021 Week 02: Transit Costs Project [(code)](https://github.com/AndyABaker/TidyTuesday/blob/main/2021_week01_transitcost.R)
First time using ggMarginal (ggExtra) to produce marginal density plots and geom_text_repel (ggrepel) to add labels.

## 22/12/2020 Week 52: Big Mac Index [(code)](https://github.com/AndyABaker/TidyTuesday/blob/main/2020_week52_bigmac.R)
First time using geom_flame (heatwaveR) to produce simple area plots and ggtext to alter the subtitle colours.
