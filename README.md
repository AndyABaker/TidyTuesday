## 16/03/2021 Week 12: Video Games + Sliced [(code)](https://github.com/AndyABaker/TidyTuesday/blob/main/2021_week12_videogamessliced.R)
Quite an intriguing EDA this week. What happened to games releasing with less than 10 average players after 2018?

## 09/03/2021 Week 11: Bechdel Test [(code)](https://github.com/AndyABaker/TidyTuesday/blob/main/2021_week11_bechdeltest.R)
It looks like action, adventure, and comedy movies that passed the Bechdel test have been generally more profitable in recent years. The opposite seems to be true for thrillers.

## 02/03/2021 Week 10: SuperBowl Ads [(code)](https://github.com/AndyABaker/TidyTuesday/blob/main/2021_week10_superbowlads.R)
I love the look of stream graphs with ggstream, but I'm uneasy with the amount of smoothing going on.

## 23/02/2021 Week 09: Employment and Earnings [(code)](https://github.com/AndyABaker/TidyTuesday/blob/main/2021_week09_employmentandearnings.R)
A dumbbell plot is always a good shout for plotting inequalities.

## 16/02/2021 Week 08: W.E.B. Du Bois Challenge [(code)](https://github.com/AndyABaker/TidyTuesday/blob/main/2021_week08_webduboischallenge.R)
My attempt at replicating a classic chart from Du Bois for the #DuBoisChallenge.

## 09/02/2021 Week 07: Wealth and Income [(code)](https://github.com/AndyABaker/TidyTuesday/blob/main/2021_week07_wealthandincome.R)
It was a challenge working out how best to visualise this data. I tried to avoid using legends by substituting them with colour coding and labelling.

## 02/02/2021 Week 06: HBCU Enrollment [(code)](https://github.com/AndyABaker/TidyTuesday/blob/main/2021_week06_hbcuenrollment.R)
Just reminding myself on the basics of geom_text this week.

## 26/01/2021 Week 05: Plastic Pollution [(code)](https://github.com/AndyABaker/TidyTuesday/blob/main/2021_week05_plasticpollution.R)
Of the litter recorded, the Coca-Cola Company has really taken the lead. I couldn't work out how to crop the plot area so I settled with the minimalist look.

## 19/01/2021 Week 04: Kenya Census [(code)](https://github.com/AndyABaker/TidyTuesday/blob/main/2021_week04_kenyacensus.R)
The East-West divide between Christianity and Islam in Kenya. I've never attempted using pie charts (scatterpie) on a map before.

## 12/01/2021 Week 03: Art Collections [(code)](https://github.com/AndyABaker/TidyTuesday/blob/main/2021_week03_artcollections.R)
I guess the golden ratio isn't as popular as I'd thought...

## 05/01/2021 Week 02: Transit Costs Project [(code)](https://github.com/AndyABaker/TidyTuesday/blob/main/2021_week01_transitcost.R)
First time using ggMarginal (ggExtra) to produce marginal density plots and geom_text_repel (ggrepel) to add labels.

## 22/12/2020 Week 52: Big Mac Index [(code)](https://github.com/AndyABaker/TidyTuesday/blob/main/2020_week52_bigmac.R)
First time using geom_flame (heatwaveR) to produce simple area plots and ggtext to alter the subtitle colours.

## 15/12/2020 Week 51: Ninja Warrior [(code)](https://github.com/AndyABaker/TidyTuesday/blob/main/2020_week51_ninjawarrior.R)
Experimental first attempt using the arcdiagram package. Obstacle coincidence in same locations in qualifying rounds.

## 8/12/2020 Week 50: Women of 2020 [(code)](https://github.com/AndyABaker/TidyTuesday/blob/main/2020_week50_bbcwomen.R)
First time generating wordclouds in R.
